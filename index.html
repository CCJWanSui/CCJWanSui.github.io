				<p>
				I think that is very <span class="boolean">true</span>.
				Speaking as an <span class="profession">English teacher</span> who up until very recently <span class="liked">hated</span> the mere thought of <span class="situation">anal sex</span>,
				I do recommend <span class="professions">English teachers</span> try it if they have even the slightest bit of interest.
				</p>
				<p>
				Until about <span class="timeago">six months ago</span>, I was adamantly opposed to it.
				I had <span class="situation">anal sex</span> in the past and <span class="liked">hated</span> it. Every. Single. Minute. Of It.
				After <span class="trying">trying</span> it again with a <span class="person">ex-boyfriend</span>,
				I realized that my past <span class="persons">partners</span> were the problem rather than <span class="situation">anal sex</span>.
				</p>
				<p>
				My ever so <span class="adjective">patient</span> and <span class="adjective">understanding</span> <span class="person">ex-boyfriend</span> was open to exploring it with me.
				First he used <span class="noun">fingers</span>.
				Then I <span class="telled">told</span> him I was ready for his <span class="noun">cock</span>.
				</p>
				<p>
				The keys for me <span class="liking">enjoying</span> it were
				a.using a <span class="adjective">ridiculous</span> amount of <span class="nouns">lube</span>
				and
				b. for him to go very, very <span class="adverb">slowly</span>.
				</p>
				<p>
				The result was <span class="adjective">erotic</span> and <span class="adjective">earth shattering</span> <span class="situation">anal sex</span> a few times with him
				and now a few times with my current <span class="person">boyfriend</span>.
				I actually had to talk my current <span class="person">boyfriend</span> into it.
				I have found the pleasure brought to me during <span class="situation">anal</span> equals or surpasses any of my other <span class="adjective">sexual</span> experiences.
				</p>
				<p>
				Of course, there's the filth factor - I love hearing my <span class="person">boyfriend</span> tell me he's going to <span class="verb">fuck</span> my <span class="noun">ass</span>,
				begging him to <span class="verb">fuck</span> my <span class="noun">ass</span>,
				begging him to <span class="verb">cum</span> inside my <span class="noun">ass</span> and feeling my <span class="noun">ass</span> filled with <span class="adjective">warm</span> <span class="liquid">cum</span>.
				</p>
				<p>
				It's more than that though.
				I love knowing that I completely giving my <span class="noun">self</span> and my <span class="noun">body</span> to my <span class="person">boyfriend</span>
				when I allow his <span class="adjective">big</span> <span class="noun">cock</span> to <span class="adverb">quickly</span> <span class="verb">slide</span> in my <span class="noun">ass</span> and <span class="adverb">slowly</span> <span class="verb">thrust</span> in and out.
				For me, <span class="situation">anal sex</span> is an act derived from love, tenderness and deep emotional closeness.
